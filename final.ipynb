    "In modern society, two of the most popular activities for our generation are watching sports and gambling. Of all the sports in America specifically, the one that constantly gathers the most viewers is football. The NFL is a multi billion dollar industry and is one that also ends up being the most bet on sport in the United States as well. These bets come from a place of knowledge of the game, but with a better model they can be much more accurately predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model to predict the results of NFL games, I needed to use a website with plenty of data regarding the NFL. The company which I got this data from is Pro Football Focus. I interned at Pro Football Focus or PFF last summer and used their resources to get plenty of advanced data on the NFL. Not only do they have raw stats available, but they also present access to advanced statistics which can help make much more accurate predictions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "From PFF, I gathered the data by examining 6 CSV files, 3 for offense and 3 for defense. From there I went and tidied up the data by removing any unnecessary columns that would not be beneficial in getting stats to predict scores. The next step was to visualize the gathered data and choosing specific stats to let us understand what information we should feed to our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in the project was to create the actual machine learning model that would allow me to predict these scores. By gathering stats from previous weeks, our machine learning model is able to predict scores for a certain week. The model will be taking offensive and defensive stats from both the home and away team and using that information to create score predictions."

No model will ever be perfectly accurate but in a game where one play can be all the difference there is an even greater amount of variance.
